    <p>Hello! My name is Cordell Hext! I was born in Wisconsin, but I was raised in Northern Michigan. Recently, I moved to Chicago, in the state of Illinois. This means that across my 25 years of living I have lived in 3 states. However I have visted many more in the central and western U.S.. However, I have never visited the east coast of the U.S., and frankly have no desire to.</p>
    <p>After high school, I went to university for 2 years to learn computer science, but left because it university wasnt the right choice for me at the time. After university I floated between jobs, eventually landing a gig working in a manufacturing plant as an electrical harness assembler. I spent about 3 years working at that job before I realized that factory work wasnt for me. The desire to start a new career led me to Chicago, where I enrolled in the i.c. stars program.</p>

            <p>Ever since I was little I always enjoyed spending my time indoors. I enjoyed playing games, watching television, and using my imagination while playing with building blocks. These childhood fascinations evolved into my hobbies today. However, with my age I often prefer to approach things with a more critical eye. I don't just want to play a game, I want to <a href="https://ludology.libsyn.com/"target="_blank"><b>know why the game is fun</b></a>, and how I can make other games fun. I don't just watch movies, I want to know what tricks the director used to make the movie more memorable.
            <br>
            <br>
        In addition, I have gained <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/minipainting/"target="_blank"><b>new hobbies</b></a> as I've grown. I've made many friends during my high school and university years, and I enjoy staying in contact with my friends. I can't always go out in person to meet, so often we spend time <a href="https://discord.com/"target="_blank"><b>online</b></a> together to stay in touch.</p>
